# What is Inheritance access specifier ?

Inheritance access specifiers are used to define the accessibity of the subsequent members of the base class in derived class. There are three types of the access specifiers.

  1. public -> This is the most common type of the access specifier in inheritance because It
     			     maintains the same scope of base class members in derived class.
     			     With public access specifier, all the public members of base class remains public
     			     in derived class and all the protected members of the base class remains protected
     			     in derived class. Inheritance access specifier is not applicable on private members.
  2. protected -> This access specifier defines all (protected and public) variables of the base class
                  as protected in the derived class.
  3. private -> This access specifier defines all (protected and public) variables of the base class
                as private in the derived class. Therefore, they are not accessible outside the derived class.
